Utility to get Facebook RTMP URL for Facebook Live.

# Usage
The service is available online at [https://srakrn.com/rtmp](https://srakrn.com/rtmp). Feel free to check out there.

# What about my privacy?
This is why I put it on GitHub. Feel free to audit all the source code (so you would be sure I'm not stealing, or storing your key in any way.)

Also, please be aware of what you stream online. Privacy matters, you know!

# I found this useful.
Glad to hear that. Share with your friends then?

# I found this awful.
Go and start your project, looking forward to seeing something wonderful! :D

# Any recommended streaming software?
For free software, I do reccommend OBS. To install, Google for OBS, and install in the manner to the guides.

macOS users, use `cask`. `brew cask install obs` works perfectly.

Don't use `cask`? `brew install cask` NOW.

Don't use `brew`? Oh, c'mon guys!
